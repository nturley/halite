    "It will be helpful to extract information from past games to form predictions. For example, A key feature in any strategy concerns the worth of a ship. In order to make decisions regarding spawning, attack, sacrifice, etc., we need some concept of the value of a ship as measured by its halite production or accomplishments in attacking or defending. This notebook is built to extract features from high level games played by others to estimate the value of a ship given various conditions.\n",

    "The following functions will be helpful in analyzing game boards and player behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Calculations for Distances** - for quick look-ups of cardinal directions and distances between cells\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **cardinal_distance(start_point, end_point)** calculates the shortest distance between two points with the output being the tuple `(dist_west2east , dist_north2south)`, where the first element represents the number of steps going eastward (negative values mean westward) and the number of steps southward (or negative meaning to the north).\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **make_cardinal_distance_list()** creates a list with precalculated shortest cardinal distances for all points on the board. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **make_total_distance_list(cardinal_distances=cardinal_distance_list, boardsize=21)** creates a list with precalculated total distance for all points.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **cardinal_distance_list[start_point][end_point]** is a list, not a function. It is created by `make_cardinal_distance_list` and outputs the cardinal distances as steps east and steps south as explained above. Very fast!\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **total_distance_list[start_point][end_point]** is a list, not a function. It is created by `make_total_distance_list` and outputs the absolute sum of the changes in cardinal distances, i.e. the Manhattan distance. Very fast!\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Calculations for Ship Destinations** - yields the destination cell for movements\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **destination_cell(start_point, move_distance)** is the reverse of the above functions. The inputs are a start point and a tuple representing steps eastward and southward, `(dist_west2east , dist_north2south)`, and the output is the end point on the map. All points are in the raw index fashion used on the game board.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **next_location(start_point,ship_action)** is the destination cell for a ship with requested `ship_action` which can be: `North`, `South`, `East`, `West` (or their first letters `N`,`S`,`E`,`W`). Any other input action, including `None` assumes no move.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **infer_ship_action(start_point,end_point, cardinal_distance_list=cardinal_distance_list)** does the reverse of `next_location`, revealing the ship action that would take a ship from `start_point` to `end_point`. This function results in an error if the start and end points are more than one distance apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Objects Within a Distance** - these functions consider the cells or cell contents within a given distance. \n",
    "\n",
    "  * **cells_in_distance(location, max_distance)** returns the index references for all cells within a specific distance from the location represented as a cell index\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **distance_kernel(maxdist)** creates a matrix that can be used in a convulution with the game board that sums all squares with distance `maxdist`\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **halite_sum_matrix(halitedata, maxdist)** with an input list of halite values for the 441 cells on the board, this function returns the sum of all halite within `maxdist` of each cell. It uses matrix convolution to calculate the sum of objects in a distance for every cell on the board, and it was intended to calculate the quantity of halite within a distance. But can easily be repurposed to calculate the sum of any values that can be represented on the board, like the number of enemy ships within a given distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deriving Ship Actions from Board Info** uses the observations data from succesive steps\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **halite_total_change(new_obs,old_obs)** calculates a dictionary of the total change in halite for each ship_id in both `new_obs` and `old_obs`, where the input variables are the observation dictionaries output by each Halite step\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **last_mining_yield(prev_action,old_obs)** calculates a dictionary of halite quantities mined where `prev_action` is 4-element list of ship action dictionaries for each of the four players and `old_obs` is the observation output dictionary from the previous halite step\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **present_prev_actions(ships_present,new_obs,old_obs)** calculates a 4-element list of ship action dictionaries for each of the four players, using the input list of ship id strings in `ships_present` which must correspond to ships that are present in both `new_obs` and `old_obs`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **investigate_mia(missing_ship_ids, new_obs, old_obs, verbose)** for the list of ship ids in `missing_ship_ids` that are present in old_obs but not in new_obs, this function investigates the cause of dissapearance and outputs three dictionaries: `missing_ship_last_action` is the best guess for the last action submitted for the missing ship, `missing_ship_killer_team` is the team number (0-3) responsible for the ship's death, and `missing_ship_killer_uid` is the ship id of the ship that destroyed the missing ship. If the ship went missing because of a CONVERT action to create a new shipyard or becaues of a suicide mission to destroy an enemy shipyard, the killer team and killer ship id are assigned to be the ship's own team and id.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * **infer_previous_action(new_obs, old_obs, verbose)** this is the main function to infer ship actions for all ships in old_obs using the above functions to assign actions to ships that are still present as well as those that are now missing. The output is a four-element list of dictionaries, one for each team, containing the ship id as as the key and the ship action as the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **A Code to Describe Board Patterns withing Distance of Three**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **nearby_features(location, max_distance)** returns a 25-element `nearby_features_array` with the features labeled in the description above. For example, a value of 2 in array index 3 indicates that a friendly ship in immediately south\n",
    "  * **rotational_equivalents(nearby_features_array)** returns the 8 features arrays that are rotationally equivalent to the `nearby_features_array`\n",
